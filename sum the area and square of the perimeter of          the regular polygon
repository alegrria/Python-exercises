        A regular polygon has n number of sides. Each side has length s.
        The perimeter of a polygon is: length of the boundary of the polygon
        Write a function called polysum that takes 2 arguments, n and s. 
        This function should sum the area and square of the perimeter of 
        the regular polygon. 
        The function returns the sum, rounded to 4 decimal places.

    return round((area + per**2), 4)
